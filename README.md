## 🌟 Why PantryPool?

Communal kitchens and office breakrooms often suffer from the "tragedy of the snack stash":
* The honor system fails with missing cash and unrecorded tabs.
* Manually updating spreadsheets or collecting receipts creates friction and chore fatigue.
* Roommates or coworkers argue about who paid for what and who drank the last cold brew.

**PantryPool eliminates the friction entirely.** Members scan a fridge QR code with their native phone camera, tap to consume an item, and the ledger updates in real time. Restockers upload grocery receipts via Gemini AI Vision OCR, and the balance automatically squares away.

## 🧭 Choosing Your Database & Architecture

PantryPool provides two deployment options depending on your hosting preferences:

| Feature | Option A: Cloudflare Pages + D1 (Serverless) | Option B: Node.js + MySQL (Self-Hosted) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | 100% Free hosting, zero server maintenance | Localhost testing, VPS (Ubuntu/EC2), Docker, cPanel |
| **Database** | Cloudflare D1 (Distributed Edge SQLite) | MySQL 8.0+ / MariaDB 10.5+ |
| **Backend** | Cloudflare Pages Functions | Node.js Server (@hono/node-server) |
| **Deployment** | `npm run setup:cloudflare` | `npm run dev` or `npm start` |

## 🚀 Quickstart & Local Development (Node.js + MySQL)

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
* **MySQL 8.0+** or **MariaDB 10.5+**
* **npm** or **pnpm**

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/donaldfellow/PantryPool.git
cd PantryPool

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your local environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set your MySQL credentials and a secure `JWT_SECRET`:
```env
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_USER="your_db_user"
DB_PASS="your_db_password"
DB_NAME="pantrypool"
JWT_SECRET="your_random_secret_string"
```

```bash
# 4. Start the local development server (auto-creates tables on boot)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5. Initial Superadmin Setup
PantryPool implements an automated **First-User Bootstrap Pattern**:
* **Fresh Database**: The very first user to register or authenticate (via email/password, Google OAuth, or Apple) automatically becomes **`superadmin`**.
* **Subsequent Users**: All users registered afterwards receive standard member privileges.
* **Environment Override**: To explicitly designate an admin upfront, configure `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@yourdomain.com"` in `.env`.
* **CLI Promotion**: Promote any registered user at any time using the command-line utility:
  ```bash
  npm run make-superadmin <email>
  ```

```

*Or manually step-by-step:*
```bash
# 1. Login to your Cloudflare account
npx wrangler login

# 2. Create the D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create pantrypool-db

# 3. Apply the database schema
npx wrangler d1 execute pantrypool-db --file=./schema.sql

# 4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npm run build
